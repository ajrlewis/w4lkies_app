 Growing up on a farm in Poland surrounded by various animals, I have always had a deep connection with pets. From chickens, pigs, horses, and cows to cats and dogs, caring for animals has been a passion of mine since childhood. After moving to Italy as a teenager, I rescued an abandoned dog and welcomed many cats into our countryside home. Now based in London for the past 10 years, I have transitioned from a career in hospitality to pursue my love for dogs. As a dedicated animal lover, I am excited to devote my time and affection to our canine companions. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, and taking long walks in nature.
