 Growing up on a farm in Poland surrounded by various animals, I have always had a deep connection with pets. From chickens, pigs, horses, and cows to cats and dogs, caring for animals has been a passion of mine since childhood. After moving to Italy as a teenager, I rescued an abandoned dog and welcomed many cats into our countryside home. Now based in London for the past 10 years, I have transitioned from a career in hospitality to pursue my love for dogs. As a dedicated animal lover, I am excited to devote my time and affection to our canine companions. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, and taking long walks in nature.

"I can't say enough great things about Sophia and her excellent dog walking services. From the first time I met her, it was abundantly clear that Sophia is a true dog lover and has a natural rapport with furry friends of all breeds and sizes. 
What sets Sophia apart is her incredible passion, patience, and attentiveness when it comes to caring for dogs. She doesn't just walk them - she provides excellent exercise tailored to each dog's unique needs and energy levels. Sophia always makes sure to let the pups sniff around, play, and expend their energy in a positive way during their walks.
In addition to her wealth of dog expertise, Sophia is incredibly reliable, punctual, and communicative. She sends detailed updates and pictures after every walk, letting you know how your pup is doing. I really appreciate her thoughtfulness in making sure my dog is healthy, happy, and engaged both mentally and physically.
What I appreciate most about Sophia though is her genuine adoration for dogs. You can tell she cherishes every interaction and sees each pup as an individual. She dotes on them, talks to them, and lavishes them with love and attention. With Sophia, your dogs will truly feel like part of her pack. 
I wholeheartedly recommend hiring Sophia as your dog walker. She provides outstanding care with a level of commitment and love that you won't find elsewhere. Your dogs are sure to adore her, and you can have complete peace of mind knowing they are in such caring, capable hands."

    <p>"Sophia has been walking Simon, my miniature Schnauzer, for a couple months now and I am really happy with her. She is on time, reliable and very good with Simon. She clearly loves dogs and mine loves her a lot. He is always very happy to see her and comes back tired and having had a lovely adventure. I can't recommend W4lkies highly enough."</p>
